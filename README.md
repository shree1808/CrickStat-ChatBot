## 🏏 CrickStat 🏏 ##

### AI-powered application for quick player insights built using LangChain, Ollama, and Streamlit. ###

**Description**:
Any cricket enthusiast wants to keep track of their favorite player's career and performance. By leveraging the power of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) like Mistral and Llama, I've developed a platform where, without exhaustive searching, one can easily obtain news and statistics about any player within a specific cricketing time frame.

**Libraries Used**: LangChain (For Integration with Ollama Models and for designing application workflow), Ollama (To run LLM models locally), Streamlit (For UI).

#### Performance Under Mistral
